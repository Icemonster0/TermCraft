# Post Mortem

Post mortem sounds cool so I'm going with it, even if the project isn't done yet.  
This is what I learned and what I could do better next time.

- Just don't do terminal graphics in general
- Use more double linked lists instead of vectors
- Rasterizers are complicated and don't *just work*, even if you did everything right
- Be more consistent with everything
- Manage memory better and more efficiently
